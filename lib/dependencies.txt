JCSMP API Dependencies

Dependencies required to build/run Solace JCSMP based applications are bundled in the lib directory.

The lib directory also includes the legacy sol-common-<version>.jar of which contents have now been moved to 
sol-jcsmp-<version>.jar and is no longer needed.

NOTICE: Including log4j-1.2.9.jar without a log4j.properties file on the classpath
may impact program performance by turning the log level to DEBUG.
